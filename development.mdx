title: Testing Your Integration
---

Before launching your integration, it's crucial to test it thoroughly.

## Sandbox Environment

Memoram provides a dedicated sandbox environment for development and testing. Use the following base URL for all API calls during testing:

```
https://sandbox-api.memoram.app/api/v1 
```

Test credentials (API keys, etc.) specifically for the sandbox environment should be available in the [Memoram Developer Portal](https://developers.memoram.app).

## Integration Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your integration is robust:

- [ ] Developer JWT Token retrieval (`/auth/token`) works correctly.
- [ ] User OAuth 2.0 flow redirects correctly and handles the callback.
- [ ] Authorization code exchange successfully retrieves user `access_token` and `memory_key`.
- [ ] Access request creation (`/access-requests`) works using the `memory_key`.
- [ ] Polling or checking access request status (`/access-requests/{id}`) functions correctly.
- [ ] Credential retrieval (`/access-requests/{id}/credentials`) works for **approved** requests.
- [ ] Secure storage of API keys and user credentials (encryption keys, refresh tokens) is implemented.
- [ ] Content encryption/decryption using the retrieved `encryption_key` works correctly.
- [ ] Memory blob creation (`/memory-blobs POST`) functions as expected (using correct `user_id`, `memoryKey`, and handling content encryption).
- [ ] Memory blob retrieval (`/memory-blobs GET`, `/memory-blobs/{id} GET`) works and content can be decrypted.
- [ ] Memory blob updates (`/memory-blobs/{id} PATCH`) modify blobs correctly.
- [ ] Memory blob deletion (`/memory-blobs/{id} DELETE`) works.
- [ ] Tag retrieval (`/tags GET`, `/tags/{id} GET`) functions correctly.
- [ ] Appropriate error handling (e.g., for 4xx/5xx responses, network issues, invalid keys) is implemented for all API calls.
- [ ] (If applicable) Token refresh logic for user `access_token` is implemented.
- [ ] (If applicable) Webhook endpoints receive and correctly verify event payloads.

## Validation Process

Before submitting your integration for potential inclusion or partnership:

1.  Complete the integration checklist above.
2.  Test with various user scenarios (e.g., new user, existing user, denied access request, revoked access).
3.  Ensure secure handling of all tokens and keys according to best practices.
4.  Prepare documentation or a description of how your tool uses Memoram.
